## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel with Upstash KV

#### Option 1: One-Click Deploy (Recommended)
Use the [Deploy with Vercel button](#one-click-deployment) at the top of this README. This automatically sets up Vercel KV (powered by Upstash) for data persistence.

#### Option 2: Manual Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)**
3. **Click "New Project"** and import your forked repository
4. **Add Vercel KV Integration**:
   - In project settings, go to "Storage" tab
   - Click "Create Store" → "KV"
   - Name your store (e.g., "project-board-kv")
   - Click "Create and Connect"
5. **Deploy** - Your project will automatically have KV environment variables configured

#### Option 3: Manual Deploy via CLI
1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy from project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd project-board
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Set up Vercel KV Storage**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new KV store
   vercel kv create project-board-kv
   
   # Link the store to your project (follow the prompts)
   vercel env pull .env.local
   ```

#### Option 4: Manual Upstash KV Setup (Any Platform)
If deploying to platforms other than Vercel, you can use Upstash directly:

1. **Create Upstash Account**:
   - Go to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account

2. **Create Redis Database**:
   - Click "Create Database"
   - Choose a name (e.g., "project-board")
   - Select region closest to your deployment
   - Choose "Free" tier

3. **Get Connection Details**:
   - Click on your database
   - Copy the "REST URL" and "REST Token"

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env.local or deployment platform
   KV_REST_API_URL="https://your-database-url.upstash.io"
   KV_REST_API_TOKEN="your-rest-token"
   ```

### Automatic Deployment (CI/CD)

#### GitHub Actions with Vercel
Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

env:
  VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
        
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Install Vercel CLI
        run: npm install --global vercel@latest
        
      - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
        run: vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
        
      - name: Build Project Artifacts
        run: vercel build --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
        
      - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
        run: vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

**Required GitHub Secrets**:
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel API token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel team/organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID

#### Setup GitHub Secrets:
1. **Get Vercel Token**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   # Go to https://vercel.com/account/tokens to create a token
   ```

2. **Get Project IDs**:
   ```bash
   cd project-board
   vercel link
   # Check .vercel/project.json for the IDs
   ```

3. **Add to GitHub**:
   - Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add the three secrets above

### Environment Variables for Production

Ensure these environment variables are set in your deployment:

```bash
# Required for Upstash KV (auto-set with Vercel KV)
KV_REST_API_URL="your-kv-rest-url"
KV_REST_API_TOKEN="your-kv-rest-token"

# Optional customization
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_SECTIONS="Proof of Concept,Development,Hyper Care"
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_MEMBERS_CSV="Alex,Sarah,Michael,Emma"

# Optional: Analytics
VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID="your-analytics-id"
```

### Other Deployment Platforms

The app can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js:

#### Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist`
4. Add Upstash KV environment variables

#### Railway
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Add Upstash KV environment variables
3. Railway will auto-detect Next.js and deploy

#### Digital Ocean App Platform
1. Create new app from GitHub
2. Configure build settings for Next.js
3. Add Upstash KV environment variables

#### AWS Amplify
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Add build settings for Next.js

### Troubleshooting Deployment

**Common Issues**:

1. **Build fails with dependency errors**:
   ```bash
   # Use legacy peer deps flag
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. **KV connection issues**:
   - Verify `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` are set
   - Check Upstash dashboard for correct URLs
   - Ensure region compatibility

3. **App falls back to localStorage**:
   - This is expected behavior when KV is not configured
   - Check environment variables in deployment platform

## Usage

1. **Create Tasks**: Click "Add Task" to create new items
2. **Edit Tasks**: Click on tasks to edit details, priority, and due dates
3. **Assign Team Members**: Click the person cell to assign team members
4. **Collaborate**: Share the URL with team members for real-time collaboration

## Technical Details
